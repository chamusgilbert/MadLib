Hello my name is Tekoah Gilbert.
Everyone says I am the {0} brother, but I am not... I am the {1} brother. In fact... I am more {1} than makyre.
I have a lot of fun {2} with my friends, named {3}, {4}, and {5}.
When we hang out we usually complain about {6} then proceed to use {6} for our games anyways.
Anyways... a typical day for me usually consists of me {7} my {8} and not putting any {9} on my body.
I often say that I have no {10}, but actually I have a whole bunch of {10}.
I often say I'm not good at {11}, but I'm actually so good at {11} that everyone calls me a {12} {13} when they {11} with me.
