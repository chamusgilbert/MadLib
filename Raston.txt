Hello I am Raston Gilbert.
I am a {0} {1}. I start off my day in a {2} mood. When I feel {2}, I will fix that by {3} for {4} hours.
When I am finished, I go to {5} to meet with {6}. {6} and I are {7} friends who often {8} together.
When I'm not with {6}, I am usually {9} with my brothers. They are {10}, but I am {11} and can often {12} my brothers with a {13}.
When I talk with a liberal, I often get {14}. I will begin to {15} and {16} until the liberal is literally {17}.
But today I am {18} because Charlie went to {19}.
